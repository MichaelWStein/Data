Notes:
(6/1/2019 AJ)
** to load data, run extractdata.py only (edited) 
**  no changes on analysis.py logic, except for additional function:
1. main function, which executes the analysis
2. global variables so it can be used by other python code (edited) 

** districtlist.py can be used separately to loop through each district guid
